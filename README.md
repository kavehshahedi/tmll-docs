# TMLL

**T**race-Server **M**achine **L**earning **L**ibrary (TMLL) is an automated pipeline that aims to apply Machine Learning techniques to the analyses derived from [Trace-Server](https://github.com/eclipse-cdt-cloud/trace-server-protocol). TMLL aims to simplify the process of performing both primitive trace analyses and complementary ML-based investigations.

TMLL provides users with pre-built, automated solutions integrating general Trace-Server analyses (e.g., CPU, Memory, or Disk usage) with machine learning techniques. This allows for more precise, efficient analysis without requiring deep knowledge in either Trace-Server operations or machine learning. By streamlining the workflow, TMLL empowers users to identify anomalies, trends, and other performance insights without extensive technical expertise, significantly improving the usability of trace data in real-world applications.
